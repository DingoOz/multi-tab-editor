Testing Instructions:
====================

To test these features:

1. Large File Warning:
   - Try opening a file larger than 50MB
   
2. File Change Detection:
   - Open a file in the editor
   - Modify it in another program
   - See the notification in the editor

3. Memory Monitoring:
   - Monitor the editor during heavy usage
   - Low memory warnings appear automatically

4. Crash Recovery:
   - Open several files
   - Force-quit the application
   - Restart to see recovery prompt

5. Error Handling:
   - Try to open non-existent files
   - Try to save to read-only locations
   - Test various permission scenarios

All error messages now provide:
- Clear descriptions of what went wrong
- Specific suggestions for fixing the problem
- Retry options where appropriate
- Better user experience overall
